I have **no** idea what I'm doing but I'm obsessed with obscure systems and clean ideas

## About Me

Hi, I’m Noé (aka Sceeker), engineer by training currently doing a PhD in "IC design".

Stuff I do *tries* to sits somewhere between formal engineering, experimental hacking, and a quiet acknowledgment of Wirth's law (oh boy do I sure love electron and alike shenanigans :ghost:).

- Working with **embedded systems** (FPGAs, MCUs)
- Developing **DIY experimental setups**, occasionally involving dangerous voltages and slightly suspicious hardware
- Strong bias towards **FOSS** things

Currently working on a bunch projects but keeping it low in case they end up never being finished :no_mouth:
